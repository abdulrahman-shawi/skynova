# SKYNOVA CRM — Agent Guide

> This file is intended for AI coding agents. It describes the project architecture, conventions, and critical details you need before modifying code.

---

## Project Overview

**SKYNOVA CRM** is a full-stack CRM / ERP web application built with Next.js 14 (App Router). It supports multi-role user management, order lifecycle tracking, warehouse inventory across two countries (Turkey and Syria), employee targets & salaries, expense tracking, customer management, analytics, and an e-commerce affiliate platform.

The UI is primarily **Arabic** and rendered **RTL** (`dir="rtl"`). Most user-facing labels, toast messages, and inline comments are in Arabic. Code identifiers (variables, functions, filenames) remain in English.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Dev server (runs on port 4000)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Lint
npm run lint
```

> **Note:** There is no test suite configured in this project. `npm run lint` maps to `next lint`.

---

## Database & Migrations

The project uses **PostgreSQL** via Prisma with the `@prisma/adapter-pg` adapter. The Prisma client is generated to `generated/prisma/`.

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Create a migration
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only

# Deploy migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Connection is configured via `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`. A `prisma.config.ts` file is also present for Prisma's new configuration format.

**Important models:** `User`, `Permission`, `Order`, `OrderItem`, `Product`, `ProductStock`, `Warehouse`, `Customer`, `Expense`, `Shipping`, `Warranty`, `Page`, `AffiliateLink`, `Commission`.

**Warehouse access control:** The `Permission` ↔ `Warehouse` many-to-many relation (`allowedWarehouses` / `allowedPermissions`, join table `_PermissionWarehouseAccess`) restricts which warehouses a role may access. An empty list means access to all warehouses. Managed from the permissions page (`app/dashboard/permissions/page.tsx`) via `/api/permissions`; enforced for orders (`server/order.ts`), wholesale orders (`server/wholesale-order.ts`), and the products page (`app/dashboard/products/page.tsx`) — admins bypass all checks. The client user payload (`/api/users/get`, `/api/users/impersonate/[id]`) includes `permission.allowedWarehouses`.

---

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Session:** JWT stored in an HTTP-only cookie named `skynova`. Expires in 30 days.
- **Middleware (`middleware.ts`):**
  - Redirects unauthenticated users from `/dashboard/*` to `/`.
  - Redirects authenticated users from `/` to `/dashboard`.
- **Roles:** `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `STAFF`.
- **Permissions:** Granular CRUD permissions per module (products, orders, customers, employees, expenses, categories, permissions, pages, analytics). Admins bypass all permission checks.
- **Impersonation:** Admins can impersonate other users via `?asUser=<id>` query param or session storage key `skynova_as_user_id`. Stop impersonation with `?asUser=me`.

### Security Considerations
- **JWT secret is hardcoded** in `lib/auth.ts` as `"secret"`. In production this should be moved to `process.env.JWT_SECRET`.
- No visible rate-limiting or CSRF token implementation.
- Passwords are hashed with `bcryptjs`.

## Code Style Guidelines

1. **TypeScript:** Strict mode enabled. Write types for all function inputs/outputs.
2. **Path Aliases:** Use `@/` for imports from the project root (e.g., `@/lib/prisma`, `@/components/ui/button`).
3. **Server vs Client:**
   - Default to **Server Components**.
   - Mark interactive components with `'use client'`.
   - Mark server-only data mutations with `'use server'`.
4. **Styling:** Tailwind CSS. Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class merging.
5. **RTL:** Dashboard layout sets `dir="rtl"`. All forms, tables, and modals should remain RTL-aware.
6. **Language:** UI text and comments are mostly **Arabic**. Keep new user-facing text in Arabic to match the existing UX.
7. **Forms:** Use `DynamicForm` + `FormInput` / `select-form` + Zod schemas.
8. **Toast Feedback:** Use `react-hot-toast` with Arabic messages (`toast.success("...")`, `toast.error("...")`).

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Server Actions
Heavy business logic lives in `server/*.ts` files as async exported functions with `'use server'`. These are imported directly into Server Components or called from Client Components for mutations.

### API Routes
Lightweight API routes exist under `app/api/` for specific needs (login, logout, impersonation, user profile, settings data-transfer, WhatsApp sharing).

### Stock Management
Orders affect stock in real time via `applyOrderStockChange` in `server/order.ts`:
- Sold/delivered statuses **decrease** stock.
- Cancelled/returned statuses **restore** stock.
- Warehouses are located in either Turkey or Syria; stock lookups fall back by location name when `warehouseId` is absent.

### Warranty
Warranty records (`server/warranty.ts`) now require a **warehouse** and **quantity** for every type:
- Creating a warranty decrements stock from the selected warehouse and logs a `StockMovement` of type `OUT`.
- `REPLACEMENT` warranties create a matching `Order` record and store its id on the warranty.
- Deleting a warranty restores the quantity to the linked warehouse. For replacements, the linked order is deleted first; for `DAMAGED`/`MAINTENANCE`, a `StockMovement` of type `RETURN` is also logged.
- `customerId` is optional. The customer field is hidden for `DAMAGED` and optional for `MAINTENANCE`, but it is still required for `REPLACEMENT` because an order must be linked to a customer.

### Cron Jobs
`lib/cron.ts` runs a monthly job (1st of month at 00:00 UTC) that deactivates active `UserTarget` records. It is imported in the root layout so it initializes once per server process.

## Deployment Notes

- The project includes PWA configuration (`next-pwa`) with service worker generation to `public/`.
- Vercel deployment is implied by the presence of `.vercel/` and `@vercel/blob` usage.
- `dev.db` exists in the repo but the app targets PostgreSQL in production.

## Quick Checklist Before Editing

- [ ] Does the file need `'use client'` or `'use server'`?
- [ ] Are you using `@/` aliases instead of relative `../../` paths?
- [ ] Are permission checks applied for non-admin users (`hasPermission` / `isAdmin`)?
- [ ] Is user-facing text in Arabic?
- [ ] Did you verify the Prisma schema reflects any new fields?
- [ ] Did you run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes?
